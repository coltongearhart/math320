\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item 5 cards are face down in a row on a table. Exactly one of them is an ace. You turn the cards over one at a time, moving from left to right. Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of cards turned \textit{before} an ace is turned over.\smallskip%Actex 4-2 (with different number)
    \item[] Find the pmf for $X$. You can write it as a piecewise function or as a table.\bigskip

    \item Let $X$ be the number of claims on an auto insurance policy having pmf
    \[
    f(x) =
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
             0.9 & x = 0\\
            \frac{c}{x} & x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
        \end{array}
        \right.

    where $c$ is a constant.\smallskip%Prob and stat inference 2.2-4 (removed deductible wording)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Determine the value of $c$ that makes $f(x)$ a valid pmf.
        \item Write the cdf $F(x)$ as a piecewise function (round to 4 decimals).%Original addition
    \end{enumerate}\bigskip
    
    \item Let $\displaystyle f(x) =\frac{7}{256} x^6, \quad -c < x < c$. Find the constant $c$ so that $f(x)$ is a valid pdf.\bigskip% Lazar HW 4 Additional question 5 (just a part of it)

    \item The lifetime of a machine part has a continuous distribution on the interval $(0,10)$ with probability density function $f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is \textit{proportional} to $(10 +x)^{-2}$.
    \item[] Calculate the probability that the lifetime of the machine part is less than 5.\bigskip%Actex 7-12 (with different numbers)
    
    \item Let $X$ have the following density function:% not sure where found problem
    \[
    f(x) =
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
             x & 0 \le x \le 1\\
             1/x^3 & 1 < x < \infty\\
             0 & \text{otherwise}\\
        \end{array}
        \right.
    \]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the cdf $F(x)$.
        \item Plot the cdf $F(x)$.
        \item Use the cdf $F(x)$ to find $P(0.5 \le X \le 5)$.

    \item The loss due to water damage for a home is modeled by a random variable $X$ with density function
    \[
    f(x) =
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
             0.005(20 - x) & 0 \le x \le 20\\
             0 & \text{elsewhere}\\
        \end{array}
        \right.
